# Metadata Management

The Metadata item in the application menu has two sections:
+ **Referential Metadata** \
Dedicated to the management of Referential Metadata, that is metadata that can be associated to any artefact in a generic way.

+ **DCAT-AP_IT** \
Dedicated to the management of Metadata in compliance with the DCAT-AP_IT standard (defined by Agit, the agency for digital Italy), which defines a set of descriptive metadata (mandatory, recommended or optional) used to document both data and catalogues dedicated to public administrations.
