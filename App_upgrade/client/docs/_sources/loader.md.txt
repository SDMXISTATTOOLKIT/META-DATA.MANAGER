# Loader

The system displays the mask for choosing the mapping and for acquiring data from CSV or SDMX-ML files.
The required fields for loading from CSV file are:
- *Mapping* (mandatory, to be chosen from a list) 
- *Import type* (mandatory, to be chosen from a list)
- *File* (mandatory)
- *Separator* (mandatory, it is pre-set with ";")
- *Delimiter* (optional)
- *Flag "Has header "* (optional, the default is ON)
- *Flag "Format .Stat "* (optional, the default is OFF)

The user can select the mapping by opening the list of mappings by clicking on the "+" in the list box, which will be populated with the chosen mapping.  \
In the field "Import type" the user sets the type of loading between the values:
- Series and Data
- data
- Series

Generally, the loading includes both the series and the data, but the user may choose to load the series first (e.g. for control) and then the data.

If only the data is loaded, the series must already be present, which is useful when updating the data.

The other fields for loading the csv are similar to those provided in the "File Mapping". \
Once all mandatory fields have been filled in the "Load CSV" button will be activated. \
After loading the csv it is possible to view the data ("Show Dataset" button) , moreover the "Import Data" button is activated to complete the loading. 

The "Embargo" function is available to deny the display of the loaded data.

The embargo can be removed manually with the "Remove Embargo" button from the "Cubes List" item. \
Otherwise it can be removed automatically by selecting the "Automatic data release" and a release date (functionality not active at the moment). \
The "Regenerate CC+Transcoding" flag allows the loading of a data item recreating also the Transcoding and the Content Constraint if they are already present. \
The system, during the importation process, checks for errors in consistency, formatting and correctness of the CSV file. 
If not, an error message is displayed.

Moreover the import is blocked when there are two duplicate rows in the csv file but with different OBS_VALUE. 

![Error loading duplicate observations](_static/img/loader_4.PNG "Error loading duplicate observations")

User can also download the report with the details of the error. \
Finally, there are cases (e.g. reference to a code that does not exist in a codelist) in which, despite the presence of errors, the process still ends successfully, 
with a certain number of rows being discarded. The report details the discarded lines and, for each of them, the first error encountered. 
In this case, in addition to the report, it is also possible to download a csv file containing all the rows with errors that have been discarded.

Even in the case of a successful import, the system displays a pop-up window with the details of the import and the possibility of downloading the report.

![Upload Info](_static/img/loader_5.PNG "Upload Info")

The user has the possibility to upload a file in "SDMX-ML" format. In this case, the following mask is available for data entry:

![Loading SDMX-ML](_static/img/loader_6.PNG "Loading SDMX-ML")

In this case the loading is done by choosing a Cube and an SDMX file containing the data. \
Pressing "+" in the list box "Cube" the System shows the Category Scheme tree for selecting the Cube, 
while pressing "+" in the list box "File" allows the user to search for the SDMX file in the filesystem. \
The third mandatory field is the "Import Type" analogous to loading CSV files. \
Once the mandatory fields are populated the "Load XML" button is activated, if the loading is successful the "Import data" button is activated 
and the user can carry out the import. \
Also for the loading from SDMX it is possible not to visualize the loaded data by selecting "Embargo" and to recreate Transcoding and Content Constraint
 by activating the flag the "Regenerate CC+Transcoding" flag.
