# Edit, duplicate and delete an existing Artefact


Once the [list of artefacts](artefact_lists.md) has been chosen and the desired [search artefact](search_artefact.md) has been performed, the user has a series of functions at line level, according to his profiling. 

  ![Edit artefact](_static/img/Strumenti_riga.PNG "Edit artefact")
  
 If the user does not have permissions to perform a certain action, the icon is not displayed.
 
 **View/Edit** \
 This button allows the user to view the Artifact Detail and update it if the user has write privileges. \
 Regardless of the type of artifact chosen, the data management mask [**General**](section_general.md) of the artifact will be opened. \
 In addition to the **General** tab, which is the same for all Artifacts, each Artifact will show other sections that must be filled in/edited according to the peculiarity of the Artifact.

 In the **General** tab, the identification information of the Artifact that should not be modified will be displayed in read-only format. 
 
 **Duplicate** \
 This button activates the function of duplication of an Artifact (it is present both at row level and in the various Artifact management masks). \
 The system opens a pop-up with the data of the source Artifact and of the destination Artifact:

* _Type_ (mandatory, by default equal to the source type, not modifiable)
* _Id_ (mandatory, the one of the Origin Artifact is proposed but can be modified)
* _Agency_ (mandatory, the one of the Artifact of origin is proposed but can be modified)
* _Version_ (mandatory, the version of the Artifact of origin is proposed increased but can be modified)

If the user considers the data correct, he can duplicate them using the Duplicate button

  Duplicating a finalized Artifact generates an unfinalized Artifact.
  
  **Delete** \
  This button activates a pop-up message for user confirmation.
  
  If the user wants to continue with item deletion he will select the confirmation button, otherwise he will select the cancel button.
 
   ![Delete artefact](_static/img/Elimina_artefatto.PNG "Delete artefact")
   
  Following confirmation the System will display the list of Artifacts updated and sorted alphabetically according to the default sorting or to the sorting carried out by the user.
