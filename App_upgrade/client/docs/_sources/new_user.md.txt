# Creating a new user

For user management there is a function that can be activated from the menu on the left-hand side by the administrator user (admin) of the node once the login has been carried out.

Selecting the item User Management the list of users present in the system, if they exist, will be shown.

![User Management](_static/img/Gestione_utenti2.PNG "User Management")

The list of Users defined in the system provides a tabular representation and special features for each list item. \
The table shows the columns:
1.	**Username** with the user key
2.	**E-mail** with the e-mail address associated with the user.
For each element of the list there are management functions that can be displayed by positioning the mouse on the element itself. \
The functions available to the Administrator are:
    + _View/Edit_ to access the detail screen
    + _Delete_ to delete a user

The list of users, if no users have been defined in the system, may be empty. \
In this case the SuperUser must create an Administrator user. 

Selecting the **Create User** button the form for the acquisition will be opened: 

![Create User](_static/img/crea_utente.PNG "Create User")

Mandatory fields are those provided for editing:
+ _Username_ for setting the user name (e.g.: Mario Rossi)
+ _Password_ for setting the password (e.g. pa$$word)
+ _Password_ to confirm the user password (e.g. pa$$word)
+ _E-mail_ to set the user's e-mail address (e.g. mariorossi@gmail.com).

At the end of the compilation, to confirm the creation of the new user, the Administrator must click on the Save button; alternatively click on the Cancel button to cancel the operation and not create the user. \
The Save function closes the new user insertion mask and returns to the list of users updated with the new element created.
