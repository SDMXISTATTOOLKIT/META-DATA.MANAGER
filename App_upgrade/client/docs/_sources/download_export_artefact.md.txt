**DOWNLOAD**\
The Download function is provided for all artefact types. \
It is a centralised function that allows the user to download an artefact to file in a specific output format. \
The function is activated through a button in the artefact List mask on each single row or from the single artefacts details.

The system opens a pop-up window where necessary data for downloading the selected artefact is set. \
The user chooses the **export format** from a list. \
The possible output formats are:

* SDMX-ML 2.1
* SDMX-ML 2.0
* CSV
* JSON
* RDF
* RTF

but depending on the type of artefact selected they may not all be available.

The user can download one or more artefacts in compressed format by selecting the **Compressed file** flag (the flag is preset not selected) and depending on the type of artefact it is possible to choose to include also the referenced artefacts by using the **Include referenced artefacts** flag (the flag is preset not selected). \
If the user chooses the **CSV** export format, the System opens a form to request further information. \
The fields required by the form are:
+ Language (mandatory)
+ Separator (mandatory, default is ';')
+ Delimiter (optional)

The system checks that at least the mandatory information has been entered and activates the Download button.

**EXPORT TO ANOTHER WS** \

+ Password (mandatory)
+ Type (mandatory, by default the same as the source type, not modifiable)
