It is also possible to give permissions on user management, although it is advisable to have a single administrator user with user management functions for each node.

The "Rules" tab contains the list of actions that can be done on objects by the user. 

Selecting the "Select All" button allows User Mario Rossi to perform all the functions of creation, update, deletion, import, download, display for the whole Suite as Node Administrator.

In the "Agencies" tab, the Administrator can select the Agencies that will be visible to the user when processing an Artifact. \
To profile a new administrator user it will be necessary to select them all.

Finally, in the "Cubes" tab, the Administrator can select the cubes or the categories of cubes on which the user can work. \
