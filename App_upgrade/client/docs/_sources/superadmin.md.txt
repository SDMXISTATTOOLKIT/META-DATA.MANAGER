# Superadmin credentials

The SuperUser is configured from the configuration file with the value "**Superadmin**". \
This allows the SuperUser to access the System with predefined credentials and configure the Suite. \
The SuperUser can modify his profile in terms of username and password or delete the default profile and generate a new one. 

**Login with the SuperUser profile**.

Once the user enters the [**Welcome Mask**](Home.md) of the Suite, he can access the **_Application_** item of interest in the left menu starting from the Configuration item.

Selecting the function Application, the system asks for authentication of the SuperUser who has the credentials which make him able to configure the application management.

The user sets the SuperUser credentials and presses the **Login** button which is activated once the User and Password have been set in the appropriate edit fields.

**Edit SuperUser profile**.

After entering the credentials, the system will open the management mask of the application configuration by clicking on the section "**User interface**". \
By selecting the section "**SuperUser credentials**" it is possible to change the password and, if necessary, create an additional SuperUser, using the appropriate button. \
The need to add more than one SuperUser is subject to the organization within the institution or entity that uses the Suite.
