# How to load a new Dataflow  	

The loading of a new Dataflow is done in 4 sequential steps:
* **Builder**: creation of a Cube associated with a DSD 
* **File Mapping**: creation of a mapping between Cube and data 
* **Loader**: loading data
* **Dataflow Builder**: Dataflow creation and publication.

can be activated from the menu on the left or from the list in the upper right of the masks used.
