# Builder

The Builder window displays the Category Work Scheme with a tree structure.

The leaves of the tree are the registered cubes. 
To manage the list of cubes the following functions are provided:

* **Create Cube \ Create Category**
* **Delete Cube \Delete Category**.
* **Update Tree**
* **Collect all**
* **Expand all**
* **Search**

![Cube Manager](_static/img/builder_1.PNG "Cube Manager")

Some functions are active or not depending on the selected element (e.g. the "Create Cube" function is active if an element of the Category Diagram is selected,
"Delete Cube" is active if a Cube is selected).


**Create Cube**

By clicking on the icon, a window appears allowing the user to choose whether to create a new cube or to create a new sub-category with reference to the one that has been selected. \
Clicking on create cube opens the mask for entering the necessary fields:
- *Cube ID* (alphabetical type, mandatory)
- *Name of the Cube* (alphabetic type, mandatory)
- *Language*
- *DSD identifier* (set by selection function, mandatory)
- *Flag "Observed value may be alphanumeric "* (optional)

The non-editable prefix of the ID field is set during configuration. \
In the "Name" field the user enters the name of the Cube for each language available in the Node. \
Selecting the "+" next to the DSD field opens a pop-up window that allows the user to view the DSDs present in the System and to choose the one to be 
used to create the Cube. \
The "List DSD" button, in the upper right corner, shows the same list of DSD present in the System. \
Once selected the DSD the mask shows the list of Dimensions and Attributes: by default will be selected and not deselectable 
the Dimensions and Attributes that in the DSD are defined as mandatory, while the optional attributes by default will not be selected, 
but can be chosen at this stage.

Among the selectable attributes there is the TID (table identifier) that is used to uniquely identify the Dataflows built from the same Cube (displayed in the image). 
from the same Cube (displayed in the tree on the left). \
In this way it is also possible, for example, to load two attributes at dataset level for two dataflows built from the same cube: 
to do this it is necessary that the user adds the TID in the cube and when loading a data file (see paragraph [Loader](loader.md)) or an attribute file, 
he loads different attribute values for different TID values. \
The user has the possibility to check the structure of the DSD and its components by clicking on the icons present next to the artefacts. \
During the creation of the Cube the System checks the correctness of the data entered. 
If the user, for instance, tries to create a Cube with an already existing ID, saving is blocked and the user is notified with an error message.

Once the mandatory fields have been filled in, the "Save" button becomes active and the cube can be saved. \
The window with all the Cube's properties is displayed whenever the Cube is selected.

**Delete Cube**

To delete a Cube, the user must select it with the mouse; in this way the "Delete Cube" button is activated. \
By clicking on the button, a mask appears asking the user to confirm the operation. If yes, the deletion is carried out.

![Delete Cube](_static/img/builder_5.PNG "Delete Cube")

Following deletion, the System automatically updates the tree of the Category Schemes. \
If a Dataflow is associated with the Cube, deletion is not allowed.


**Create Category**

Clicking on the "+" icon the user can create a new Category, a window is opened where the user has to type the Category ID, the Name and, optionally, the parent of the Category among those already defined.
Categories can be moved under other categories with drag&drop functionality.

**Delete Category**

To delete a Category, the user must select it with the mouse; the "Delete Category" button will only be active if the Category does not have any associated cubes.
When the button is clicked, a mask appears asking the user to confirm the operation. If so, the deletion is carried out.

**Update tree**

This function allows the user to update the Category Diagrams tree to show changes following the creation and deletion of cubes and Category Diagrams.

**Collect All**

This function displays the Category Tree in a reduced form.

**Expand all**

This function displays the Category Tree in an exploded view.

**Search**

The search is carried out by means of an editable field in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, as described in [Search in the list of artefacts](search_artefact.md).
