In this section we describe the functionalities available for Dataflow management:
* **View Annotation**
* **Publication** 
* **Preview on the Data Browser**
* **Preview**
* **Additional Information**
* **View/Edit**
* **Download**

**Display Annotation**

The presence of an annotation is indicated by the symbol "i". The click allows the user to visualize the annotation details.

**Publication**

It allows the user to set the Dataflow in production, see section: [How to put a Dataflow into production](put_dataflow_into_production.md)

**Preview on the Data Browser**

The icon is visible only if the Dataflow has been published and allows the visualization of the Dataflow with the Data Browser tool associated to the application, if present.

**Preview**

The information contained in the Dataflow is shown in table format with the possibility of sorting and filtering the columns or searching for items.

**Additional information**

The "Additional information" button allows the user to display information about the Cube and the corresponding view of the Dataflow.

**View/Edit**

The "View/Edit" function allows the user to view or edit a Dataflow, for this last part see section: [How to update an existing Dataflow](update_dataflow.md)

The system displays all the Dataflow elements:
- *General Data*
- *Queries*
- *Categorisation*
- *Header*
- *Layout annotations*

in windows identical to those seen in the creation phase of the Dataflow. 

In the mask "General data" the general information of the Dataflow are shown.

The "Query" mask displays the selected cube elements and the defined filter.

The "Categorisation" mask displays the category to which the Dataflow is associated.

The "Header" mask displays information about the header if it has been selected.

**Download**

The "Download" button allows the user to download the Dataflow in different formats. It is possible to download in compressed format.

"SDMX Structure Specific v 2.1" and "SDMX-JSON" are special data download formats in which the user can select the size to be used as the observation level

and get the downloaded data in the chosen form with the dimension at observation level:

Once the user has completed the mandatory fields the "Download" button is activated and he can download the dataflow.

**Delete**

The "Delete" button allows the user to delete a Dataflow. The System shows a pop-up mask where the user can confirm or not the operation.
