# Login and User Types

_**Login**_ \
In order to access the application functions in read and write mode, the profiled user (administrator and/or user of the node) must choose the node for which he is profiled, the desired language and log in. \
Selecting the **Login** button, located in the top right-hand corner of the [Welcome Mask](Home.md), the System asks the user to enter his username and password in order to login.

To access the application functions there are different **types of user**:
+ SUPERUSER \
User dedicated to the System initialisation, to Application Configuration management(e.g. connections to nodes) and to the definition of other super-users. 
+ ADMINISTRATOR
User dedicated to the complete management of the Suite at node level. \
If the administrator user has been set as user manager, he can also define new users (also administrators) and manage the users at single node level.
+ USER
Accesses the System through login (user and password). \
Has read and write permissions to manage Artifacts relative to the Agency for which he has been profiled by the System Administrator at node level.
+ ANONYMOUS USER
Accesses the System without logging in and therefore no credentials are provided for this user. \
It has only read permissions on the SDMX Artifacts for the various nodes with the possibility of downloading Artifacts in the Meta Manager. \
It can perform read-only access (search and display) to DCAT modules. \
Does not have access by default to the Data Manager application.
