# Agency Schemes

Selecting **Agency Schemes** from the "Meta Manager" module, the application displays the list of the Node's Agency Schemes similar to the lists of all artefacts present, as explained in [list of artefacts](artefact_lists.md). \
Selecting an element of the list with the mouse and pressing the View/Edit button, the System shows the Detail mask.

The main section of the Agencies Scheme detail mask contains the following tabs:
+ [**General**](section_general.md)
+ **Items** \
The Items can be displayed in grid or tree mode. By default the grid view is proposed.

As an alternative to the insertion of the single items, it is possible to [**import a CSV file**](item_import_file_csv.md) in order to insert them in bulk, otherwise the management functions of the single items are the following: 
* **Create Item** \
To create a new Item, the user must use the _Create Item_ button at the top. \
The System presents the data acquisition mask. \
The fields to be populated are the following: \
-- **Identifier Item** (mandatory - alphanumeric) \
-- **Language** (mandatory - alphanumeric) \
-- **Item name** (required - alphanumeric) \
-- **Description** (optional - alphanumeric) \
-- **Fullname** (optional - alphanumeric) \
-- **Order** (optional - numeric) \
-- **Parent** (optional - from a list of items already present) \
-- [**Annotations**](Annotations.md) (optional - alphanumeric) \
The new Item is displayed as a record of the grid table and the possible information related to the "Parent Code" is valorized in a column of the grid view.
* **Add Child** \
The _Add Child_ button is activated on the "Parent" row and opens a mask with the fields indicated in **Create Item** where obviously the _Parent_ field will be preset with the value of the selected parent. \
The new Item is inserted with indentation under the Parent code in the "folder" representation. \
The mask contains the buttons for system acquisition: **Save:** to save and close the mask and **Close:** to close the mask without saving. \
In the folder view, the order and the parentship of an item can be determined by drag-and-drop operations of the item itself. \
The user can switch to the folder view by clicking on the "Tree" button.
