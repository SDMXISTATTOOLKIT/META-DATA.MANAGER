# How to add data to an existing Dataflow

The ability to add data to an existing Dataflow results in loading the data into the Cube from which the Dataflow is derived.

In the section: [How to load a new Dataflow](load_new_dataflow.md) we have listed the actions necessary to create a Dataflow 
having only the DSD available:

* **Builder**: creation of a Cube associated with a DSD 
* **File Mapping**: creation of a mapping between Cube and data 
* **Loader**: data loading
* **Dataflow Builder**: Dataflow creation and publication

To add data to an existing Dataflow only the third step is needed: [Loader](loader.md) which allows the loading of data from CSV or SDMX-ML files. \
The loading of a new file in the Cube will affect all Dataflow derived from it.

In the case of published Dataflows in which "Transcoding" or "Content Constraint" are present, the update is not immediately visible as these functions
 lock the dimensions values to the codes present at the time of publication. \
In order to acknowledge the presence of new values deriving from the data update, the "Regenerate CC+Transcoding" option must be selected, 
which allows the loading of data by recreating also the Transcoding and the Content Constraint. \
For each operation's details see section: [Loader](loader.md).
