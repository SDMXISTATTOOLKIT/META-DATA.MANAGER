# How to create different Dataflows from the same Cube 

The creation of different Dataflows from the same cube must be seen as the definition of different views from the same data.

In the section: [How to load a new Dataflow](load_new_dataflow.md) we have listed the actions necessary to create a Dataflow 
having only the DSD available:

* **Builder**: creation of a Cube associated with a DSD 
* **File Mapping**: creation of a mapping between Cube and data 
* **Loader**: data loading
* **Dataflow Builder**: Dataflow creation and publication 

To create a new Dataflow from the same Cube only the last step is needed: [Dataflow Builder](dataflowbuilder.md) which allows the 
the creation of a Dataflow from a Cube present in the tree of the Category Schemes. \
For the details of each operation see the Dataflow construction in the section: [Dataflow Builder](dataflowbuilder.md).
