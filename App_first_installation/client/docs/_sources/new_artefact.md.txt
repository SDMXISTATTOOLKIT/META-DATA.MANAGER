# Creating a new Artefact

Once the [list of artefacts](artefact_lists.md) desired has been chosen, to create a new Artefact, the user must select the **New** button in the top right corner. \
Regardless of the chosen Artifact type, the management mask of the [**General Data**](section_general.md) of the Artifact will be opened.

   ![New Artifact](_static/img/Nuovo_artefatto.PNG "New Artifact")
   
Once the user has filled in the fields of the mask, the System verifies the presence of the compulsory data and the correctness of the data entered while setting them. \
Only after completion of the minimum and mandatory information, the System activates the save function using the **Save** button. 

```eval_rst

    :maxdepth: 3
    :hidden:

    General Section <section_general.md>
