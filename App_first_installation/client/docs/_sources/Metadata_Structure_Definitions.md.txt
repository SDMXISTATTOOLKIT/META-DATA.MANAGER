# Metadata Structure Definitions

Selecting **Metadata Structure Definitions** from the "Meta Manager" module the application displays the list of Metadata Structure Definitions of the Node similar to the lists of all artefacts present, as explained in [list of artefacts](artefact_lists.md). \
Selecting an item in the list with the mouse and pressing the View/Edit button, the system displays the Detail mask.

 This is a particular SDMX artefact and represents a template for reporting and dissemination of reference metadata. \
 The Suite does not provide the creation of new artefacts of this type, so user can only [import an external MSD](import_artefact.md) through the import button in the top right corner of the MSD List.
