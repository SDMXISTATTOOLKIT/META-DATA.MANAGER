# Search an existing Artefact

The search function is necessary for the management of Artefact lists with a high number of elements.

Once the desired [list of artefacts](artefact_lists.md) has been chosen, the search for an artefact in the list can be done in two ways:

![Search Artefacts](_static/img/ListaArtefatti_cerca.PNG "Search Artefacts")

* using the centralised mode within the mask: the function is present in the masks of the Artefacts list management and is represented
 by an editable field that applies, already in the typing phase, in dynamic mode, the result of the search on the Artefacts list.

* at column level, activating the provided search filters. \
For the columns Agency, Version and Final, the filter shows the list of possible values. \
For the ID and Name columns the filter allows the user sto edit a subset of characters to apply the selection to the Artifacts. \
Once the filter value(s) has been chosen, where applicable, select the Apply function to make the selection valid. \
The coloured filter symbol indicates that a filter is active. \
To remove it, select the filter and then select Reset.
