**Artefact**

In order to describe and document data, the SDMX standard refers to entities that are called "artefacts" that are organized in such a way as to represent the data and reference it appropriately.
The **Id**, **agency** and **version** are the three identifying elements of an SDMX **artefact**.

**DATABASE**

A database is a set of structured data, i.e. homogeneous in content and format, stored in a computer, representing the digital version of a data archive or filing cabinet.

Directive 96/9/EC[2] defines b.d. as: "a collection of works, data or other independent elements systematically or methodically arranged and individually accessible by electronic means or otherwise" (Art. 1. no. 2); and provides for legal protection of "databases which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of the material, constitute the author's own intellectual creation" (Art. 3).

**DSD** - **_Data Structure Definitions_**

SDMX artefact, is the definition of a data structure in terms of its components, i.e. dimensions, attributes and measures.

Dimensions: components that identify and describe the observed phenomenon.

Attributes: components that only describe the observed phenomenon.

Measures: components that represent the observed phenomenon(s).

Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, positions or enables easier retrieval, use or management of an information resource. \
They are often referred to as 'data about data'.

**MSD** - **_Metadata Structure Definitions_**

SDMX artefact, is a model for reporting and disseminating reference metadata.

In addition to what is called "structural metadata" which mainly concerns the definition of the data structure, it may be useful to share other information such as, for example, information on methodology, data quality, sources, contact details.\.
This data in SDMX is called "referential metadata" and finds its framework in the Metadata Structure Definition and appropriate additional concepts.

**NSI_WS**

The NSI Web Service on SOAP or REST request collects the data from the DDB and the structural metadata from the MSDB, creates the SDMX-ML data and sends it to the client. \
