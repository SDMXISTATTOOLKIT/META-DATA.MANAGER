# How to update an existing Dataflow

From the list of created Dataflows select the Dataflow to be modified. \
From the functions displayed in the icons on the right choose "View/Edit" which, in addition to displaying it, allows the user to edit the Dataflow.  \
The System shows all the elements of the Dataflow:
- *General Data*
- *Query*
- *Categorisation*
- *Header*
- *Layout annotations*

in windows identical to those seen in the creation phase of the Dataflow. 

If the Dataflow is not in production and if the user has the necessary permissions he can use the windows to make changes to the Dataflow.

Some information, such as the Dataflow identifier, cannot be modified, a prohibition symbol appears on these and they cannot be edited.

The user can modify the URI, validity, name and description in the General Data mask. \
In the mask "Query" it is possible to change the selection of dimensions and attributes and to change the set filters. \
In the mask "Categorisation" the user can change the category to which the Dataflow is associated. \
In the "Header" mask it is possible to modify the Dataflow header by clicking on the "Dataflow with header" flag. \
The annotations previously set for the Dataflow can be modified in the "Layout annotations" mask.

For the details of the single operations see the [Dataflow builder](dataflowbuilder.md).

With the "Save" button all changes made to the Dataflow are saved.
