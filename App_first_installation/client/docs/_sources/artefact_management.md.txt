# Artefact Management

The Meta Manager application is aimed at browsing and managing Structural Metadata according to the SDMX standard. \
The main functions are related to the creation and modification, search, navigation, display, import, download of Structural Metadata, called **Artefacts**, through connection to a specific Node. \
The **Id**, **agency** and **version** are the three elements identifying an SDMX **Artefact**, independently from the type of artefact we are dealing with. \
The **Id** is the identification code of the Artefact. \
**Agency** is the name of the organization that is the creator and/or owner of the Artefact. \
**Version** gives the version of the Artefact. 

As they are defined and to favour the usability of the Suite, it has been chosen to standardise some functionalities common to several artefacts:

```eval_rst
* :doc:`Artefact Lists <artefact_lists>`
* :doc:`Search an existing Artefact <search_artefact>`
* :doc:`Creating a new Artefact <new_artefact>`
* :doc:`Edit, duplicate and delete an existing Artefact <edit_delete_artefact>`
* :doc:`Import an Artefact <import_artefact>`
* :doc:`Item Management - Upload CSV file <item_import_file_csv>`
* :doc:`Download or export an Artefact <download_export_artefact>`
* :doc:`Annotations <Annotations>`
* :doc:`Sorting Management <sorting_management>`
```

```eval_rst
 .. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 4
    :hidden:
