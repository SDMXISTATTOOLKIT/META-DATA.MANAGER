 Item schemes can be loaded indifferently from:
 * MSDB
 * CSV
 * SDMX-ML
 
  Once the choice of the two Item Schemes (e.g. two Code Lists) has been made, the System activates the **Compare** and **Generate Report** buttons. \
  The user, by pressing **Compare**, can perform the comparison obtaining the result with the differences on the screen:
