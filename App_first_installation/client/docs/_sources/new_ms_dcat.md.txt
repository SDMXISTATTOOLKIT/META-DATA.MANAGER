 By filling in the mandatory fields the user will have to choose a Metadataflow among those available through a drop-down menu. \
 The Metadataflow available will only be those dedicated to the MSD of the DCAT-AP_IT (whose configuration, in the next image, is made by the Superuser at Node level) owned by the user.
