# User Interface

In this section the [SuperUser](superadmin.md) has the possibility to set the parameters related to the standard of views:

+ **Maximum tree nodes for allowing tree visualization** \
This parameter represents the maximum display in tree representation of the elements (e.g. Item of a Code List). \
The system manages vertical scrolling for the display of items and this also allows high values of the parameter.

+ **Maximum showable tree nodes using 'Show more' in tree** \
The parameter is linked to the value set in the previous point. \
The system allows the loading of further elements for displaying them through the function Show Others. \
The number of elements that are displayed is determined by this pagination parameter in the tree representation.

+ **Minimum nodes number to enable tree pagination** \
Indicates the minimum number of elements displayed in the tree view. \
The minimum number is indicative and relative to the actual number of elements present in the system.

+ **Maximum tree nodes for allowing tree total expansion** \
Indicates the maximum number of elements that can be displayed with the tree fully expanded. 

+ **Tree page size** \
Indicates the maximum number of siblings that are displayed by default. 

+ **Default sidebar collapsed** \
The on/off checkbox allows the user to set as default the display of the left sidebar menu in extended (header) or compressed (icons only) mode.

+ **Languages** \
The Languages section allows the user to define the languages for the Suite. \
The Add Language function opens an editing window where the user can set the language in character format. \
By saving the configuration the user obtains at application level the language management for the graphic interface (labels, titles, etc.) \
The languages are always represented by a pop-up list (combo).

+ **Default language** \
The System Administrator can define the default language, which is automatically set in all application sessions.

+ **Anonymous pages** \
In this session the Administrator can set the functionalities visible to an anonymous user who logs in without credentials. \
The mask shows all the functions present in the Suite divided between the two main applications Data and Meta Manager. \
By selecting the checkbox associated with the function, the anonymous user is authorised to have read access to the function itself.
