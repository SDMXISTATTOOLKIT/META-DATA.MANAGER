# Referential Metadata

Referential Metadata is linked to Structural Metadata (managed in the MetaManager) and the link is the [Metadata Structure Definition](Metadata_Structure_Definitions.md) (MSD) which is a model that specifies the types of constructs to which metadata can be related and the structure of this metadata at the time of dissemination. \
In particular from an MSD it is possible to create [MetadataFlows](Metaflows.md) which represent a metadata flow with the characteristics defined by the MSD and are the starting point in the management of Referential Metadata.
